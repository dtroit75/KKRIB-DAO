# Off-plan Real Estate DAO Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) leveraging the power of Web3 technology #ICP to manage participant proposals in an off-plan real estate project. The DAO operates on the principles of community consensus, where members contribute to the development of a promising real estate venture through a consent-based approach.

## Motivation
Off-plan real estate projects often face challenges in funding, decision-making, and community engagement. By utilizing a DAO framework, this project seeks to address these challenges by empowering community members to participate in project development, decision-making, and resource allocation.

## Features
- **Participant Management**: Allows for the addition, removal, and management of participants involved in the real estate project.
- **Contribution Tracking**: Tracks the contributions of each participant to the project, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Consensus-based Decision Making**: Facilitates community consensus through democratic voting mechanisms for project-related decisions.
- **Project Transparency**: Provides visibility into project progress, financials, and decision-making processes to all stakeholders.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilizes smart contracts to automate and enforce project rules, transactions, and governance mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
- **Motoko**: Programming language for building Web3 applications on the Internet Computer (IC).
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilized for implementing DAO functionalities, including participant management, voting mechanisms, and resource allocation.
- **Internet Computer (IC)**: Blockchain platform used for hosting and executing decentralized applications (dApps) with high security and scalability.
