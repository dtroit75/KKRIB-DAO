# KKRIB-DAO

# Off-plan Real Estate DAO Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) leveraging the power of Web3 technology #ICP to manage participant proposals in an off-plan real estate project. The DAO operates on the principles of community consensus, where members contribute to the development of a promising real estate venture through a consent-based approach.

## Motivation
Off-plan real estate projects often face challenges in funding, decision-making, and community engagement. By utilizing a DAO framework, this project seeks to address these challenges by empowering community members to participate in project development, decision-making, and resource allocation.

## Features
- **Participant Management**: Allows for the addition, removal, and management of participants involved in the real estate project.
- **Contribution Tracking**: Tracks the contributions of each participant to the project, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Consensus-based Decision Making**: Facilitates community consensus through democratic voting mechanisms for project-related decisions.
- **Project Transparency**: Provides visibility into project progress, financials, and decision-making processes to all stakeholders.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilizes smart contracts to automate and enforce project rules, transactions, and governance mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
- **Motoko**: Programming language for building Web3 applications on the Internet Computer (IC).
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilized for implementing DAO functionalities, including participant management, voting mechanisms, and resource allocation.
- **Internet Computer (IC)**: Blockchain platform used for hosting and executing decentralized applications (dApps) with high security and scalability.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd KKRIB_DAO/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
